MONOLITHIC SPLIT DATA FUNCTIONALITY ANALYSIS AND FIX
=====================================================

INVESTIGATION FINDINGS:
-----------------------
The monolithic version (visualizer.py) ALREADY HAS the Split Data functionality implemented:

✅ EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY:
1. Split Data button at line 262-263: ttk.Button(split_frame, text="📊 Split Data", command=self.split_data)
2. Radio buttons for Train/Val/Test selection at lines 277-281
3. Comprehensive split_data() method at lines 3038+ with:
   - Professional popup dialog with split ratio controls
   - Preview functionality showing frame counts
   - Random shuffling and assignment of frames
   - Validation of ratios totaling 100%
4. Dataset navigation methods: get_dataset_frames(), navigate_dataset_frame()
5. Move Set button functionality
6. Status bar integration showing current dataset and navigation info

🐛 ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:
Case sensitivity mismatch in data storage:
- PROBLEM: Split data was being stored as uppercase ('TRAIN', 'VALIDATION', 'TEST')
- BUT: Navigation methods expected lowercase values ('train', 'validation', 'test')
- FIX APPLIED: Changed storage to use lowercase values to match navigation expectations

📋 CODE FIX APPLIED:
Line 3152-3156 changed from:
  self.data_splits[frame_idx] = 'TRAIN'        → self.data_splits[frame_idx] = 'train'
  self.data_splits[frame_idx] = 'VALIDATION'   → self.data_splits[frame_idx] = 'validation'  
  self.data_splits[frame_idx] = 'TEST'         → self.data_splits[frame_idx] = 'test'

🎯 CURRENT STATE:
- Monolithic version now has COMPLETE split data functionality
- Case sensitivity issue resolved
- Should work identically to modular version
- UI/UX is comprehensive with professional dialog and preview

🚀 USER ACTION:
The Split Data button should now work correctly in the monolithic version.
Test by:
1. Run: python visualizer.py
2. Click "📊 Split Data" button in the Data Management section
3. Adjust ratios if desired (default: 70% train, 20% val, 10% test)
4. Click "Split" to apply
5. Use Train/Val/Test radio buttons to navigate different datasets
6. Use navigation arrows to move within selected dataset

The monolithic version actually has MORE sophisticated UI than the modular version,
including a full dialog with preview and ratio adjustment capabilities.
