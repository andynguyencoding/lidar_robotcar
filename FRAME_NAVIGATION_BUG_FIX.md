## Frame Navigation Bug Fix Summary

### Problem Description
**Bug:** When user navigates from frame_1 → next → prev, they do not return to frame_1. Instead, they may end up at a different frame due to inconsistent state management.

**Root Cause:** The `next()` method in the `DataManager` class was missing a crucial line that resets the `_read_pos` pointer, while the `prev()` method correctly included it. This caused the dataframe cache to get out of sync during forward navigation.

### Technical Analysis

**Before Fix (buggy code):**
```python
def next(self):
    self._pointer += 1
    return self._lidar_dataframe  # Missing _read_pos reset!

def prev(self):
    if self._pointer > self._data_start_line:
        self._pointer -= 1
        # Reset read position to force re-reading of the dataframe
        self._read_pos = self._pointer - 1  # This was correct
    return self._lidar_dataframe
```

**After Fix:**
```python
def next(self):
    self._pointer += 1
    # Reset read position to force re-reading of the dataframe
    self._read_pos = self._pointer - 1  # Added this missing line
    return self._lidar_dataframe

def prev(self):
    if self._pointer > self._data_start_line:
        self._pointer -= 1
        # Reset read position to force re-reading of the dataframe
        self._read_pos = self._pointer - 1
    return self._lidar_dataframe
```

### Impact
- **File Modified:** `pginput.py` (line 203-207)
- **Change:** Added `self._read_pos = self._pointer - 1` to the `next()` method
- **Consistency:** Now both `next()` and `prev()` methods handle `_read_pos` consistently
- **Scope:** Affects all frame navigation throughout the application

### Verification
The fix has been thoroughly tested with:
1. ✅ Unit tests with synthetic data 
2. ✅ Real user scenario simulation (frame_1 → next → prev → frame_1)
3. ✅ Integration testing with actual data files
4. ✅ Compilation verification
5. ✅ Consistency check with other navigation methods (`first()`, `last()`, `next_modified()`, etc.)

### Expected Behavior After Fix
- User starts at frame_1
- User clicks "Next" → correctly moves to frame_2
- User clicks "Prev" → correctly returns to frame_1
- All frame navigation operations maintain consistent state
- Dataframe cache properly refreshes on every navigation operation

### Files Involved
- **Modified:** `/home/andy/mysource/github/lidar_robotcar/pginput.py`
- **Test File:** `/home/andy/mysource/github/lidar_robotcar/test_next_prev_fix.py`

This fix ensures that frame navigation works correctly and consistently throughout the LiDAR visualizer application.
