Summary of New Features Implemented:

ðŸ”´ PREVIOUS FRAME DIRECTION LINE (RED)
- Added red direction line in pygame simulation showing previous frame's angular velocity
- Displayed alongside the current frame direction (green line) 
- Uses same scaling and direction ratio configuration as current frame
- Slightly thinner line (width=2) to distinguish from current direction (width=3)

ðŸŽ® PREVIOUS ANGULAR VELOCITY UI CONTROLS
- Added "Prev Angular Velocity" text field (read-only) below current angular velocity
- Shows the angular velocity value from the previous frame
- Updates automatically when navigating between frames
- Displays in red color to match the red direction line

ðŸ”„ REPLACE FUNCTIONALITY
- Added "Replace (R)" button below the previous angular velocity field
- Clicking the button replaces current angular velocity with previous frame's value
- Keyboard shortcut "R" or "r" also triggers replace functionality
- Automatically updates the data, visualization, and UI after replacement
- Works in both inspection and continuous modes

ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

1. State Management:
   - Added self.prev_angular_velocity variable to store previous frame data
   - Added self.prev_turn_var and self.prev_turn_entry for UI display
   - Added self.replace_button for replace functionality

2. Navigation Integration:
   - All frame navigation methods now call update_previous_angular_velocity()
   - This includes: prev_frame(), next_frame(), first_frame(), last_frame()
   - Also includes modified frame navigation methods
   - Continuous mode animation also updates previous angular velocity

3. Pygame Rendering:
   - Added red direction line rendering after the green current direction line
   - Uses same mathematical calculations with previous angular velocity value
   - Respects augmented mode settings and direction ratio configuration

4. Keyboard Handling:
   - Added "R" key support in on_key_press() method  
   - Updated focus checking to include prev_turn_entry
   - Updated keyboard shortcuts display to include "R=Replace"

5. UI Layout:
   - Vertically stacked below current angular velocity input
   - Previous angular velocity field is read-only (gray background)
   - Replace button spans full width for easy access
   - Updated instructions to mention "R to replace"

ðŸŽ¯ USER WORKFLOW:
1. Navigate between frames (current direction = green, previous = red)
2. Previous angular velocity field automatically shows previous frame's value
3. Click "Replace (R)" button or press "R" key to copy previous to current
4. Current angular velocity updates and both lines move accordingly
5. Changes are immediately reflected in visualization and can be saved

All features work seamlessly with existing functionality including:
- Dual navigation system (all frames vs modified frames)
- Frame input field for direct navigation  
- Direction ratio configuration
- Augmented mode
- Save functionality for preserving changes
