DATA SPLITTING UI/UX CONSISTENCY UPDATE
=======================================

OBJECTIVE: Make data splitting UI/UX consistent between monolithic and modular versions
APPROACH: Adopt the superior monolithic UI design for both versions

CHANGES APPLIED:
===============

1. MODULAR VERSION (visualizer_core.py) - MAJOR UPDATE
   ----------------------------------------------------
   BEFORE: Simple fixed-ratio split with basic messagebox
   - Used fixed ratios from self.ui_manager.split_ratios
   - No user interaction for ratio adjustment
   - Basic success messagebox only

   AFTER: Sophisticated popup dialog (matching monolithic)
   - Professional popup window (350x300) with proper centering
   - Title: "Split Data into Sets"
   - Real-time frame count display
   - Interactive split ratio controls with spinboxes (Train/Validation/Test)
   - Live preview showing exact frame counts and percentages
   - Input validation (ratios must total 100%)
   - Split and Cancel buttons
   - Escape key binding for cancel
   - Error handling and user feedback

2. MONOLITHIC VERSION (visualizer.py) - NO CHANGES NEEDED  
   -------------------------------------------------------
   Already had the sophisticated UI design:
   ✅ Professional popup dialog
   ✅ Interactive ratio controls
   ✅ Live preview functionality
   ✅ Split and Cancel buttons
   ✅ Input validation
   ✅ Proper error handling

CONSISTENCY ACHIEVED:
====================

BOTH VERSIONS NOW HAVE:
- Identical popup dialog layout and size (350x300)
- Same title: "Split Data into Sets"
- Interactive spinbox controls for Train/Validation/Test ratios
- Real-time preview showing frame counts and percentages
- Input validation ensuring ratios total 100%
- Split button to perform the operation
- Cancel button to abort
- Escape key binding
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Professional visual design with consistent spacing and fonts

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
==================
- Default ratios: 70% Train, 20% Validation, 10% Test
- Random shuffling of frames before assignment
- Case-consistent storage (lowercase: 'train', 'validation', 'test')
- Proper cleanup and window management
- Integration with existing status display and data change tracking

VALIDATION:
===========
✅ Both versions compile successfully
✅ UI consistency achieved
✅ All required buttons present (Split, Cancel)
✅ Professional user experience maintained
✅ Error handling and validation consistent

The data splitting functionality is now completely consistent between 
monolithic and modular versions, providing users with the same high-quality
interactive experience regardless of which version they use.
